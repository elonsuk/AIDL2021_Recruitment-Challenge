# AIDL2021_Recruitment-Challenge
Introduction: Analysis based on Kaggle's "Top Streamers on Twitch 2020" dataset. Predictions for the number of Followers gained are made utilizing the Tensorflow 2.6 DNN model. Also a recruitment challenge for joining AIDL 2021 at HKUST.

<br>```Trial 1_5LDNN.ipynb```: got a RMSE loss value of 424781.0, what a shame. Made some mistakes here; I wouldn't read this, but will keep this here.
<br>```Trial 2_Data Augmentation+9LDNN.ipynb```: augmented the dataset by adding random artificial data that lies in the IQR range of Followers gained.
